# Configuration

Settings in Selva are handled through YAML files.
Internally it uses [ruamel.yaml](https://yaml.readthedocs.io),
so it supports YAML 1.2.

Settings files are located by default in the `configuration` directory with the
base name `settings.yaml`:

```
project/
├── application/
│   └── ...
└── configuration/
    ├── settings.yaml
    ├── settings_dev.yaml
    └── settings_prod.yaml
```

## Accessing the configuration

The configuration values can be accessed by injecting `selva.configuration.Settings`.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from selva.conf import Settings
from selva.di import Inject, service


@service
class MyService:
    settings: Annotated[Settings, Inject]
```

The `Settings` object is a `dict` like object that can also be accessed
using property syntax:

```python
from selva.conf import Settings

settings = Settings({"config": "value"})
assert settings["config"] == "value"
assert settings.config == "value"
```

### Typed settings

Configuration loaded from YAML files are all `dict`s. However, we can use `pydantic`
and the dependency injection system to provide access to settings in a more typed
manner:

=== "application.py"

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from selva.configuration import Settings
    from selva.di import service
    
    
    class MySettings(BaseModel):
        int_property: int
        bool_property: bool
    
    
    @service
    def my_settings(settings: Settings) -> MySettings:
        return MySettings.model_validate(settings.my_settings)
    ```

=== "configuration/settings.yaml"

    ```yaml
    my_settings:
      int_property: 1
      bool_property: true
    ```

## Environment substitution

The settings files can include references to environment variables that takes the
format `${ENV_VAR:default_value}`. The default value is optional and an error will
be raised if neither the environment variable nor the default value are defined.

```yaml
required: ${ENV_VAR}         # required environment variable
optional: ${OPT_VAR:default} # optional environment variable
```

## Profiles

Optional profiles can be activated by setting the environment variable `SELVA_PROFILE`.
The framework will look for a file named `settings_${SELVA_PROFILE}.yaml` and merge
the values with the main `settings.yaml`. Values from the profile settings take
precedence over the values from the main settings.

As an example, if we define `SELVA_PROFILE=dev`, the file `settings_dev.yaml` will
be loaded. If instead we define `SELVA_PROFILE=prod`, then the file `settings_prod.yaml`
will be loaded.

Multiple profiles can be activated by setting `SELVA_PROFILE` with a comma separated
list of profiles, for example `SELVA_PROFILE=dev,prod`. The framework will iterate
over the list and merge the settings found on each one. The precedence is from last
to first, so settings from one profile overwrite settings from the previous ones.

## Environment variables

Settings can also be defined with environment variables whose names start with `SELVA__`,
where subsequent double undercores (`__`) indicates nesting (variable is a mapping).
Also, variable names will be lowercased.

For example, consider the following environment variables:

```dotenv
SELVA__PROPERTY=1
SELVA__MAPPING__PROPERTY=2
SELVA__MAPPING__ANOTHER_PROPERTY=3
```

Those variables will be collected as the following:

```python
{
    "property": "1",
    "mapping": {
        "property": "2",
        "another_property": "3",
    },
}
```

### DotEnv

If running you project using `selva.run.app`, for example `uvicorn selva.run:app`,
environment variables can be loaded from a `.env` file. The parsing is done using
the [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) library.

By default, a `.env` file in the current working directory will be loaded, but it
can be customized with the environment variable `SELVA_DOTENV` pointing to a `.env` file.
